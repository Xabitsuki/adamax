# A Movie behind a Script

## Abstract

What kind of script do you have to write for your movie to prosper? How have movies' scripts changed across the years? In this project we investigate whether a movie's script has an impact on the movie's popularity and whether scripts typically follow certain patterns, perhaps depending on the movie's genre. Moreover, we provide an analysis of how movies' scripts have evolved through the years. Using the [OpenSubtitles](https://icitdocs.epfl.ch/display/clusterdocs/OpenSubtitles) dataset to analyze movies' scripts and the [IMDb](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) dataset to measure movies' popularity, we hope to answer the questions laid out at the beginning of this paragraph and provide a better insight to what makes a good and a bad movie.

## Research questions

- How does the complexity of words employed by a movie affect its popularity?
- How does the spread of words in a movie affect its popularity?
- How has the presence of dialogues in movies evolved across the years?

## Questions for TAs

- How can we link the IMDb dataset with OpenSubtitles?
- Is there a good library/way to analyze text?
- Are we allowed other programming languages and/or tools than Python? NVivo for instance.
