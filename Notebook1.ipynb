    "(Considering only the folder OpenSubtitles2018) The dataset presented consists of 31GB of xml files where we can find the subtitles in different languages of movies, tv shows and trailers. The data is separeted in different folders, first separating the subtitles by language, then by year and finally by identifier. Each Id is supposed to be its IMDb identifier but this needs to be checked. There are some year folders however that are not indicative, we can find folder 0. We can also notice that per film we can have multiple subtitle xml files. The decompressed xml files vary a great deal in size aswell, we can have 9000KB file and 5KB."
